A basic rule of thumb for investors in the stock market is to ``diversify''; that is to spread one's money across stocks which are likely to behave differently in response to various conditions in the market. Risk to the investor is reduced because, under a given set of circumstances, some stocks in the portfolio will rise while others fall.

The data provided are daily stock prices from January 1988 through October 1989, for ten aerospace companies. Given this information, the first step toward answering the question posed above is to reformulate the question in terms of these data. For example, two stocks may be considered similar if they maintain approximately the same level, vary to a similar degree, or tend to move up and down in related ways over some relevant time period. An initial analysis might use some graphical techniques to examine these aspects of the data. 

The stock prices of each company are visualized using ggplot and similarities are found using mean and variance for each stock.
